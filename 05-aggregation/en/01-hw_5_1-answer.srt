1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,380

2
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,920
OK, and for this problem we
asked you to figure out the

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,400
author that has the most
comments posted.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,690
This is the author
of a comment.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,620
Now to do this, we will unwind
the comments array that is

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,720
inside each of the blog posts.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,190
And then we'll group by the
comment author right here.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,830
And then we'll just sum them
up and count them.

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,510
And then we're going to sort
by num comments minus 1

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,860
descending and limit by 10.

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,070
And if we do that, and we run
it-- and I already ran it.

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,490
You can see here the results,
we can see that the person

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,760
with the most comments posted
on to the blog posts is

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,110
Mikaela Meidinger at 493.

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,360
And that is the answer.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,460
