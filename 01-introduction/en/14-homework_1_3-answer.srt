1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
And the answer is 366.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,090
So let me just demonstrate
how it works.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,740
So here's the zip file.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,900
I'm going to unzip it.

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,835
And cd into the directory.

6
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:14,270
You see there's a
pom file there.

7
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:20,217
And then I'm going to go back
and copy this Maven command

8
00:00:20,217 --> 00:00:22,165
and execute it.

9
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:23,630
And it runs.

10
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,000
You can see the answer is 366.
