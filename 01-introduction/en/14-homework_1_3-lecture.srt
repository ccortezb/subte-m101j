00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Before 1.3, we want to make
sure that you have JDK

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,940
installed, Maven, and that you
can run a Maven-based project

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,360
that uses the Mongo
Java driver.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,970
So you should get the tar
zip file and expand it.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,940
And then cd into the right
directory that

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,140
we've mentioned here--

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,650
hw1-3.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,840
And when you run the command, we
said, make sure you run the

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,450
whole command as one line,
or it won't work.

10
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,700
Good luck.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,300
