00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140


2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,460
All right.

3
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,360
And the answer is that homework and the final exam

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,470
count in your grade.

5
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:06,820
Quizzes don't count.

6
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,750
Class participation--

7
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,089
we don't really count that.

8
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:12,419
But that does bring up a good point, which is that if you

9
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,500
want to get answers to your questions, there are forums.

10
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,059
And you can ask questions.

11
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,849
And there is 10gen staff monitoring those forums, as

12
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,700
well as your fellow students are in the forums.

13
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:23,949
And they may answer your questions.

14
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,039
