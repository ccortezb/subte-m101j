1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,210
So now let's put it
all together.

3
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,990
So we have our
HelloWorldSparkFreemarkerStyle

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,840
from the last lesson.

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,710
And then we have our
HelloWorldMongoDBStyle.

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,485
Let's combine them into
HelloWorldMongoD

7
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:12,735
BSparkFreemarkerStyle.

8
00:00:12,735 --> 00:00:15,010

9
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,470
So I'm just going to copy
all the code from

10
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,760
HelloWorldSparkFreemarkerStyle.

11
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,790
So we can reuse all that, copy
that into here, and go to

12
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,930
MongoDBStyle, and grab these
pieces MongoClient, database,

13
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,720
and collection.

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,850
And copy them into here.

15
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,920
And we're going to make this
final, since we know that the

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,110
compiler will complain
if they don't.

17
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,870
Now here, we don't need our map
anymore because what we're

18
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:51,650
going to do instead is get
our DBObject and call

19
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,585
collection.findOne, like
we did before.

20
00:00:55,585 --> 00:00:57,280
And we're going to pass
this document

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,070
right into our template.

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,400
Now, the reason this works is
because the template is

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,840
expecting a map.

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,550
And while DBObject isn't a map,
the actual concrete class

25
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,990
returned by collection.findOne
is a class called

26
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,560
BasicDBObject.

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,370
And basic DBObject ultimately
extends LinkedHashMap, which,

28
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,360
in turn, extends HashMap,
which implements Map.

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,600
So Freemarker will happily take
a DbObject from Mongo and

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,420
process it, just like it
would any other Map.

31
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,108
So let's start this up.

32
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:34,100

33
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,615
And remember what's
in our document.

34
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:42,460

35
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,800
We have a document with
a name of MongoDB.

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,180
So we would expect this template
to print out, "Hello,

37
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,430
MongoDB" again.

38
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,790
So let's try it.

39
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,440
We'll refresh, and
indeed it does.

40
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,190
It says "Hello MongoDB." So in
this exercise, we combined all

41
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,270
three of our tools--

42
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,990
MongoDB, obviously, and, Spark,
and Freemarker into a

43
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,240
single application.

44
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,810
