1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,380

2
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,670
So we've seen Spark, our web
framework, and Freemarket, are

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,430
our templating engine.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,570
Let's try now to put
them together.

5
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,130
So I'm going to steal this code
from HelloWorldSparkStyle

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,070
and copy it into a
new class called

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,320
HelloWorldSparkFreemarkerStyle.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,330

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,630
So we have Spark.

10
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:25,250
Now let's go back to our
Freemarker code and take this

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,980
piece, our Freemarker
configuration.

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,070

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,890
Change that to this class,
although it it won't really

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,030
make a difference.

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,360
So in my route, I'm going
to take the code from

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,435
HelloWorldSparkFreemarkerStyle
and copy it into my route.

17
00:00:42,435 --> 00:00:47,010

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,680
Let's clean this up
a little bit.

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,060

20
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,480
So I now have my route with my
Freemarker template created

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,140
within the route.

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,010
It's complaining that the
configuration is not final

23
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,170
because I'm accessing it from
within an inner class.

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,080
So I'm going to make
that final.

25
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,410
And it's also complaint not
return anything from the

26
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,030
Handle method, so I'm going to
bring the writer out and just

27
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,570
return writer on the bottom
outside of the try block.

28
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,490
And I'm going to put
a halt in here.

29
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,070
Is telling Spark that
there's a problem.

30
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,090
We should return a 500 error.

31
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,105
So this looks good.

32
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:24,470
And let's try to run it.

33
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,720

34
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,575
So we'll got to our web browser
and we'll refresh

35
00:01:30,575 --> 00:01:34,590
that, and it says "Hello
Freemarker" now in the web

36
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,380
application.

37
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,740
And let's review.

38
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,390
So in this class,
HelloWorldSparkFreemarkerStyle,

39
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,430
we created our Freemarker
configuration, here.

40
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,310
We defined a route for
the slash, the

41
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,810
route path of our website.

42
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,150
The handle method create
a template for

43
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,200
hello.ftl, which is here.

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,430
We also create a string writer
that Freemarker processes the

45
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,930
template into.

46
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,020
We define a map with a name
key, and a value of

47
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,200
Freemarker.

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,680
We process the template,
passing the map and the

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,009
writer, and we return the
writer at the end.

50
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,623
The system.out.print line
is not relevant.

51
00:02:13,623 --> 00:02:15,390
So I'll just get rid of that.

52
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,320
And that is a basic Spark and
Freemarker-based website.

53
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,570
