1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,010
And the answer is that the
homeworks and the final exam

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,050
are what counts.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,440
And the quizzes don't count
toward your final grade.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,360
And neither does your
class participation.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,690
We can't really tell what you're
doing when you watch

6
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,660
the videos, of course, but you
are encouraged to participate

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,550
in the forums and talk
to other students

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,800
as much as you can.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,580
