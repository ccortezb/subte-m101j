00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
This is Jeff, and I want to
review the system requirements

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,140
for the class before we start
installing other software.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,410
So first, operating systems.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,330
So we test the class on
two operating systems.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,620
We test on OS 10.8.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,100
But early versions of
OS 10 should work.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,150
We just haven't tested
with them all.

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,430
And we also test on Windows 7.

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,790
Again, earlier and later
versions should work, but we

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,350
test on Windows 7.

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,940
And if you want to use Linux--

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,400
we don't test the class on
Linux, but there's no reason

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,490
that it shouldn't work.

14
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,400
All the software
that you need--

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,520
Mongo, Maven, Java is all
available on Linux.

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,350
So that should work fine.

17
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,340
For the JDK, we require
version 1.6.

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,950
And that's what we test with.

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,670
We also test with 1.7.

20
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,410
If you want to confirm what
version of the JDK you have,

21
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,750
you can go to a terminal
window and

22
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,020
type java minus version.

23
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,940
Shows that I'm running
1.7.0, which is fine.

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,590
And you can also a test
your Java C version.

25
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,880
And again, I'm running 1.7.0.

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,960
So that'll work, too.

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,210
So make sure that you have a
recent version of OS 10, of

28
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,430
Windows, or of Linux, and you
have either JDK 1.6 or JDK 1.7

29
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,680
installed as well.

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,580
