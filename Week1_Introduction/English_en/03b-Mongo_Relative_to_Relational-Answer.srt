1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,250

2
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,890
And the answer is that MongoDB
deliberately omitted joins,

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,460
because joins are
not particularly

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,060
horizontally scalable.

5
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,010
Indexes are supported within
MongoDB, and they're supported

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,970
because they're very necessary
for good performance and do

7
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,920
not prevent horizontal
scalability.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,390
Secondary indexes are offered,
so strictly by the wording of

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,240
the question, they
were not omitted.

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,770
But to be honest, they're very
challenging to perform well

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,490
across a system which is
horizontally scalable.

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,750
And the final one is
transactions across multiple

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,440
collections.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,360
And that is specifically omitted
by MongoDB because it

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,580
is very difficult to support
transactions across multiple

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,760
collections across a system
which is horizontally scaled.

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,010
