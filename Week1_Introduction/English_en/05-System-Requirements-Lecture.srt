00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360


2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,209
All right, so let's talk about the system requirements for

3
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:03,250
this course.

4
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,540
So first there's the operating system.

5
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,660
So we'll make sure everything in the course works on Mac OSX

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,570
and Windows 7.

7
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,160
So you can also run it on Linux, and everything should

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,010
work there as well.

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,950
And let us know, actually, if you're running this on Linux

10
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:22,269
and run into issues, and we'll help you get through them.

11
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:25,480
Now, as far as Node.js, you should be fine just using the

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,519
latest version of Node.js, and actually, if you look on their

13
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,039
page, you can see the system requirements

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,780
for installing Node.js.

15
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,189
So let's take a quick look at that.

16
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:38,049
So here we're on the Node.js site, and what you can do is

17
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:39,809
you can click on Downloads.

18
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,340
And here we can actually see all the

19
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,600
different options available.

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,914
So all of these should work.

21
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:47,829
Just find your system here and download the right installer.

22
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:49,079
