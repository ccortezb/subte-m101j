.. note::

   The team uses a `Kanban board in Huboard
   <http://huboard.com/MongoDBPeru/subte-m101js>`_ to track and manage
   assignments caption files, please consider it to make contributions.

   Usually, at least a team member will verify and discuss your changes before
   merging. So you may have to do more than one commit per pull request.

.. tip::

   As you translate, it is easier to have a modern video player where can use
   the subtitles, such as VLC and Dragon Player. For this only have to make
   sure to download videos from YouTube and specify the same names that is
   assigned for the subtitles.
