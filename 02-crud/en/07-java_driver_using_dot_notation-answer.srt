1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,150

2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,460
The answer is the third one,
it will return a document

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,070
containing a single field
containing the document's _id.

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,520
Since we didn't exclude the
_id field, and there is no

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,940
"media.url" field as the
question stated, we should get

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,370
just a document with a single
field representing the _id of

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,620
the document.

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,330
