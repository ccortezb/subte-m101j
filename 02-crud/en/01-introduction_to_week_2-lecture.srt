Welcome to week 2

our lead consulting engineer.

00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:08,552
And he's going to start off
the week by going through

5
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:10,566
all the different CRUD operations:

6
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:14,980
creating, reading, updating
and deleting data from the mongo shell.

7
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:17,899
Then Jeff Yemin in going to go through
a lot of the same operations

8
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:20,207
but from the perspective
of the java driver.

00:00:20,207 --> 00:00:22,425
And at the very end of the week,

10
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:25,146
I will take you though
the internals of the blog

00:00:25,146 --> 00:00:27,881
