1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,310

2
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,000
So the answer is the document
with ID two.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,890
The reason is because we're
sorting on value descending,

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,730
so the first one which you
get back is 20, and then

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,962
10, and 7, and 5.

6
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:15,230
So we're skipping the
first two, so we're

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,400
skipping 20 and 10.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,310
So the next one will be 7, and
since we're limiting by 1, 7

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,700
is the only one returned.

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,630
That has ID of two.

11
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,880
