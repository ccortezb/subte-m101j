1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,620
Let's go over the answer
to this problem.

3
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,530
All the code you needed to add,
you can put in the user

4
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,200
DAO object, the data
access object.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,780
There were two places
you needed to work.

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,250
The first one was in this
addUser function.

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,260
And you would need to create a
Basic DB Object then add the

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,440
key value pairs for
the username,

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,340
underscore id username.

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,560
And the password, which is
going to be the hashed

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,750
password that comes
out of this make

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,870
password hash function.

13
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,930
Now, if the email is present,
and then you also add it to

14
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,690
the document.

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,860
So it depends on whether or not
the person gave an email

16
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,260
when they signed up.

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,320
Then you insert it right here.

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,090
And normally it will insert
without a problem.

19
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,660
But if the user name has been
used before, then you'll get a

20
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,120
Duplicate Key error which you
handle by returning false from

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,950
this function.

22
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,120
Now, to check when they log in,
you have to add code to

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,540
validateLogin.

24
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,910
And in that case, you simply
find one creating a new Basic

25
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,760
BD Object with the key id
set to the username.

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,360
So that's the way you'd
find the right

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,770
document for the user.

28
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,610
And then, you check right here
to see if it's null.

29
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,600
And if it's null, then
you return null.

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,570
And that's it.

31
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,030
So we gave you a lot of this
code, and that's all you

32
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,790
needed to do to make the blog
work for sign up and sign out.

33
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,040
