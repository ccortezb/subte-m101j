1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120

2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,560
Let's talk about the session
management and how the user

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,410
interface works inside
the blog.

4
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,400
You don't actually need to
completely understand this to

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,010
do the problem this week, but
it's good to have a basic

6
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:09,760
understanding of it.

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,340
So they have MongoDB, and--

8
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,920
here I'll show it as this,
running as a mongod process.

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,490
And you have your application.

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,290
And your application
is written in Java.

11
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,350
And inside it, it's got
FreeMarker, which is a

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,940
templating engine for the views,
which I'll show you,

13
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,320
and then Spark Application
Server.

14
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,280
So initially you're
going to sign up.

15
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,560
And so you're going to do a GET
request, right here, that

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,070
is going to result in the page
coming back to you, the

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,840
sign-up page, with a bunch
of fields, four fields.

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,900
This is the reply
from the GET.

19
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,940
And then you're going to submit
that with a bunch of

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,510
information with a post.

21
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,170
And at this point, what's
going to happen is the

22
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,170
application, if it's a valid
sign up, is going to respond

23
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,380
with a redirect to
the welcome page.

24
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,220
Now they'll also be
a cookie set.

25
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,240
And this is an important part
of the process, because the

26
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,230
application server before it
does this redirect and after

27
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,670
it crosses your post of your
sign-up information-- this is

28
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,910
the sign up form.

29
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,560
So when it processes this post,
it's going to write the

30
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,720
users table.

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,220
So it's going to write
the users table.

32
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,380
It's also going to write
the sessions table

33
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,820
and start a new session.

34
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,850
And it's going to take a piece
of information from the

35
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,790
sessions collection.

36
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,610
I should really call it a
collection not a table, it

37
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,880
would be more accurate.

38
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,080
And it's going to set that the
cooking in the redirect.

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,850
So when your browser does a
GET of the welcome page--

40
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,130
here's the welcome page--

41
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,590
it's going to present
that cookie.

42
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,150
So the redirect generates a GET,
which generates a reply

43
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,770
on this page that's going to
welcome you, individually.

44
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,110
Welcome Andrew.

45
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,420
So how does that work?

46
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,780
Well on that redirect, the
cookie is set, and now your

47
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,450
browser is going to present
that cookie.

48
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,780
And that cookie is going
to be checked.

49
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,550
When the welcome page gets
processed, the database-- the

50
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,630
application, rather, is going
to do a read query to Mongo,

51
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,890
and say oh, do I recognize
that session cookie.

52
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,260
And if I do, who's the user?

53
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,650
And then, show me the
right information.

54
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,160
So all the session management
happens via this cookie, which

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,765
rendezvous the information from
request to request with

56
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,140
the user information.

57
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,210
So let me show you specifically
what I mean.

58
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,240
So here's the blog itself.

59
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,290
And you can see it's welcomed
me right now.

60
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,460
And I'm on the welcome page.

61
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,585
This is after I signed up.

62
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:24,300
I've downloaded a cookie
utility, which you can

63
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,670
download as well, if you want.

64
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,800
And this cookie utility will
show me the cookies the

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,290
browser's going to present
to the website.

66
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,360
In this case, you can see that
it's presenting this long

67
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,140
random string starting
with VBL.

68
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,060
And if you look here, in
MongoDB, you can see when we

69
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,560
looked at the sessions table,
here was that same cookie,

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,360
right here.

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,600
The same piece of information.

72
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,270
So when the web browser
requested the welcome page

73
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,275
with the cookie, then the
application looked up and said

74
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:54,730
oh, it must be this user,
erlichson, and then it

75
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,130
presented my information.

76
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,320
And it customized the page
accordingly, right here.

77
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,930
So just again, if you go to the
login page, right, what's

78
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,340
going to happen is when I type
in one username and password

79
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,200
here, like erlichson, and if I
type the right one, then there

80
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,970
was just a round trip, where in
response to the post, the

81
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,340
application responded with a
redirect to the welcome page

82
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,530
along with the cookie that
is set properly,

83
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,915
associated with my user.

84
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,760
All right, so now that we
understand the way the session

85
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,240
management works, then I'm going
to go through some of

86
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,090
the way the code is structured,
so you understand

87
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,340
the way it all fits together.

88
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,170
