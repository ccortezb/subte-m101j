1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Both the second and the
fourth are correct.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,860
The second is correct because
we're saying new BasicDBObject

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,260
where type is quiz, and then
we're pending score and a

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,040
BasicDBObject with both
a gt and an lt

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,150
criteria appended to it.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,850
And the fourth one is the same,

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,080
except using query builder.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,850
We say QueryBuilder.start,
type is quiz, and score

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,750
greater than 20 and
less than 90.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,360
And then we have to get it.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,640
Called the get method of query
builder, so that we can pass

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,890
it to find.

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:32,390
