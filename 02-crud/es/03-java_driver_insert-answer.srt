1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,260

2
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,220
The correct answer is C, yes,
because the removeField call

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,810
will remove the _id key
added by the driver

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,390
in the first insert.

5
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,910
So essentially what will happen
here is when we call

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,540
insert the first time, the
driver will create an _id

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,520
field in that document.

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,850
Then we'll remove it.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,340
And then when we call insert
again on the same document,

10
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,010
there won't be an _id field and
the driver will insert a

11
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,890
different, unique object
id for the _id field.

12
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,140
