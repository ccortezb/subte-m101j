1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,220

2
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,880
So the correct answer is the
third one because with find

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,850
the first parameter to find
is the query criteria.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,240
So we're looking
for everything.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,110
So we have to still give it an
empty query criteria, which is

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,640
why we have this new
Basic DB object

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,120
that's am empty document.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,340
And then, the second parameter
is the field selection, and we

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,450
have a Basic DB object phone
number of one, but then we

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,970
have to exclude ID explicitly
by saying ID is zero.

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,220
