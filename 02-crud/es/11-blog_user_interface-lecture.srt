00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,630
Hi, this is Andrew again.

3
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,320
In this class, we're going to
use a blog as a project that

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,670
we're going to use throughout
the course.

5
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,710
And you're going to build
different parts of it.

6
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,780
This week we're going to work on
three different parts-- the

7
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,970
author sign up, the author log
in, and the author log out.

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,430
The authors are the only ones
who need to sign in and sign

9
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,150
out of our blog.

10
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,550
And the idea is that viewers
can use it anonymously.

11
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,730
So let's go through what
the user interface

12
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,390
looks like for this.

13
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,690
Here I have our web browser.

14
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,810
And we're going to be
running the blog.

15
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,140
So here I'm going to first
show you how to

16
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,450
get the blog started.

17
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,680
So when you download the code
for this week's homework

18
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,790
assignment, homework problem
three, you'll see a couple

19
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,260
different things, including
a validation script

20
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,730
and a small run file.

21
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,650
In the run file, you'll see
there's this mvn command that

22
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,390
will run it.

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,880
You can import the
pom into an IDE.

24
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,190
So you don't necessarily need
to run it using mvn.

25
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,580
But it should work if you
run it using mvn.

26
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,080
So I'm going to do that.

27
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,730
So you can see here it started,
and it started on

28
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,610
port 80/82.

29
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,380
So if we go to port 80/82 and we
hit return, we can see that

30
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,600
we have a placeholder
for our blog.

31
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,620
Now, we only have three
URL routes that are

32
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,590
currently set up.

33
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,180
One of them is to sign up for
the blog, and another one is

34
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,950
to log in, another one
is to log out.

35
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,590
So I'm going to sign up for
the blog right here.

36
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,930
And I'm going to type
my user name--

37
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:24,200
erlichson.

38
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,870
And I'm going to give
myself a password--

39
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,910
fubar.

40
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,150
And then I'm going
to hit Submit.

41
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,930
And when I do that, you can see
that I'm redirected to the

42
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,290
welcome page, which welcomes
me by name.

43
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,520
And let's go to my home
or to my log out page.

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,050
So if we just log out of the
blog, then I can log

45
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,410
back into the blog.

46
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,300
If I type the wrong password in,
it'll say invalid login.

47
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,920
And if I type the right password
in, I go back here.

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,650
So there were three different
URLs that

49
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,500
we implemented there--

50
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,370
log in, log out, and
the sign up URL.

51
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,760
Now, I'm showing you a completed
version of the

52
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,360
homework assignment where the
code has been inserted by me

53
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,979
so that the whole thing actually
works properly.

54
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,870
But you'll have to do that part
yourself in the actual

55
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,840
assignment.

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,330
And then if you look here and
see what happened internally--

57
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,100
I'm going to quit out of here.

58
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,170
I run Mongo.

59
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,320
I'm going to use blog.

60
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,700
And I'm going to look at
the user's collection.

61
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,070
And you can see right here
there's an entry in the users

62
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,690
collection--

63
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,850
id erlichson, a hash version
of my password along with

64
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,440
[? assault ?]

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,660
in this users table.

66
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,280
And there's also something
in the sessions table.

67
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,650
And the sessions code we're
going to leave in for you.

68
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,950
But the sessions code,
there's a long,

69
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,330
random, and my username.

70
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,460
So that's how the user interface
works and what you

71
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,800
should see in database.

72
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,460
And so now I'm going to go over
the overall structure of

73
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,610
this project to show you what it
looks like so you know how

74
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,860
to work on it.

75
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,240
