1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,150

2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,160
In this problem, we asked you to
find all the student scores

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,070
where the exam grade was greater
than or equal to 65.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,960
And we asked you to sort those
and find the student with the

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,990
lowest exam grade that
is above 65.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,360
So to do that, we do a Find.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,040
We limit ourselves
to Type Exam.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,830
We look for scores that are
greater than or equal to 65.

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,170
I'm suppressing the ID operator
here just to make it

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,640
easier to read the output.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,180
And then I'm sorting
by score ascending.

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,280
And when you do that, you get
the following records.

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,180
And you can see the student that
is just above 65 their

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,320
exam grade is student ID 114.

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,570
And that was the answer.

16
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,390
