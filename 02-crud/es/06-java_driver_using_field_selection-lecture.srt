1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,220

2
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,370
OK, so in this lecture, we're
going to talk about selecting

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,640
the fields from documents
in your queries.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,320
So the code that I have here is
similar to what we saw in

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,620
the last lecture.

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,440
Just to make the code shorter,
I broke out the random number

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,520
to the top.

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,170
And I've added a third the
field to the document, z,

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,520
which is a number between
zero and 999.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,260
I'm using the same queries using
query builder, querying

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,240
for documents where x is 0, and
y is greater than 10, and

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,620
less than 70.

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,120
Let's just run it to
make sure it works.

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,120
It only matched one document.

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,100
Let's run it once more.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:42,290
Still one and zero.

17
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,040
All right, that's better.

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,850
So this matched three
documents.

19
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,730
And you see we have the ID
fields and x, y, and z.

20
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,390
But it's kind of silly to get
the x field because we're

21
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,380
querying for x is zero, so why
bother selecting x, since we

22
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,070
know it's going to be zero?

23
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,920
So can we get rid of x from
our query results?

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,610
The answer is yes.

25
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,390
We do that using the second
parameter to the find method

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,650
to select the fields that we
want to have returned.

27
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,810
So there's a few ways
to do this.

28
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,100
But since what we're trying to
do here is get everything but

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,270
x, we can do it by saying
x is false.

30
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,240
So we create a document where
x is false, and that just

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,170
means return everything but
x, and let's run it again.

32
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,080
And now we have the ID,
and we have y, and we

33
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,070
have z, but no x.

34
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,070
Now let's say that what we
actually want is only y.

35
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,420
We don't want z or x.

36
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,690
So rather than saying x false,
y false, we can just change

37
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,470
this to y and true
to get only y.

38
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,110
And x and z are gone.

39
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,250
And we have y.

40
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,910
But we also have this ID.

41
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,520
And usually, we're going
to want the ID.

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,820
But in the cases where we don't,
we can exclude it by

43
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:05,130
appending _id, false, saying we
do not want the id field.

44
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,479
And if we run that again,
we only get y,

45
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,060
which is what we wanted.

46
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,130
OK, now let's do a quiz.

47
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,375
So given a variable, name
students, of type

48
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,320
DBCollection, so we have a
DBCollection of student

49
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,050
documents, which of the
following lines of code can be

50
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,280
used to find all documents in
the collection, retrieving

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,240
only the phone number field.

52
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,960
So we have student.find,
a new basic DBObject.

53
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,180
Phone number 1, a pen
idea of zero.

54
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,920
Students.find new basic DBObject
phone number one,

55
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,160
students.find new basic
DBObject, new basic DBObject

56
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,240
phone number 1, append id 0,
and students.find new basic

57
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,110
DBObject, phone number
1, append ID of

58
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,530
0, new basic DBObject.

59
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,780
