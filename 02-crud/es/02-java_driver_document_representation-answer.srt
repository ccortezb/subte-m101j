1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,150

2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,270
The correct answer is D, we need
to use new BasicDBObject

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,710
to create our document with
a _id field with the value

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,690
"user1." And we append
an interest field

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,970
whose value is an array.

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,585
And we use Array.asList
"basketball" and "drumming."

7
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:17,910
The first one's not
right because

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,840
we can't use a HashMap.

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,240
The second one's not right
because we can't append

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,960
interest with two values.

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,730
It can only have
a single value.

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,100
The third one's not right
because DBObject is an

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,660
interface not a concrete class,
so we can't create an

14
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,910
instance of it.

15
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,410
