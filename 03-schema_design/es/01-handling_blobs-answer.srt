1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,200

2
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,350
OK, and the answer is
that only the third

3
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,660
one is actually true.

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,200
GridFS stores large blobs
in two collections.

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,700
The first one says that it
stores it in a single

6
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,300
collection, which is not true.

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,840
Each GridFS document is not
given a unique file name.

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,950
And it turns out that GridFS
does not compress

9
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,200
your file on disk.

10
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,080
So I don't know if you realized
that, but it did not

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,580
compress it.

12
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,550
So if you want to compress your
file you'll have to do it

13
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,890
before you send it to GridFS.

14
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,140
