1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140
 

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,840
In this problem you're given a
collection of students and

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,440
you're being asked to remove the
lowest homework grade for

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,390
each student.

5
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,350
You can see that there's one
document per student--

6
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,300
right here we're looking at
Mariette Batdorf's document--

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,500
and that there's a scores
key with a array of

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,830
assessments within it.

9
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,340
And you'll need to iterate
through this list and then

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,620
find the lowest homework--
so in this case, the

11
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,270
homework for 7.6--

12
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,010
and you'll need to remove it.

13
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,720
And the way you'll do that is
by creating a new list and

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,670
then doing an update statement
to the collection, isolating

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,880
the record that you're looking
at, and updating the scores

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,620
collection with the new
list of assessments.

17
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,750
And then after you're done with
that, you're going to run

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,300
an aggregation command that we
give you to find the student

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,800
with the highest average
in the class.

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,050
