00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120

2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,710
In this second homework
assignment, you're going to be

3
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,900
working on our blog
project again.

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,650
Now, this time, you're going to
be adding the insertion and

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,900
retrieval of the posts from the
posts collection so that

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,880
it can show posts and
take new posts.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,450
So here I have the finished
version running.

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,710
And I am going to create
a new account on it.

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,840
And now I'm going to
create a blog post.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,940
And this is what yours is
going to have to do.

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,730
And I'm going to create my
first blog post here.

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,620
And this is the body
of my post.

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,920
I'm going to add some tags.

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,720
And now I'm going
to submit it.

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,210
And it's going to bring
to the permalink for

16
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,280
this post right here.

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,250
This is my blog post posted
here, by me is the body of my

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,590
post posted under
foo, bar, baz.

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,475
And now I'm going to go
to the blog home.

20
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:54,185
It's going to show that post.

21
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:57,460
If I want to create another
post, I can do that.

22
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,130
My second post, I'll
make that bigger.

23
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,730
And now I'm going to
submit it again.

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,170
And now I'm going to go
to the blog home.

25
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,410
And you can see this
is the blog home.

26
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,880
So the URLs that
you need to get

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,580
working for this homework--

28
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,730
and we're going to leave the UI
in so you just need to do

29
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,330
the Mongo parts of it--

30
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,720
is that you have to allow the
person to create a new post.

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,230
And you have to allow
the viewer to

32
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,930
see the list of posts.

33
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,360
And this gets the last
10 most recent posts.

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,110
You can search for XXX again
inside the code to find the

35
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,650
parts you need to work on.

36
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,520
And then, if you click on one of
these links for the post--

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,530
this is the most recent post.

38
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,350
I'm going to click on the title
of this right here.

39
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,400
Then it's going to bring
me to the permalink.

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,390
So it says, my second post is
the permalink in the URL.

41
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,770
And again, this part's all
implemented already.

42
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,280
And that permalink's going to
show you the body of the post.

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,310
And there's this UI stuff to
allow you to add a comment.

44
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,860
But we're not going to worry
about that for this homework.

45
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,870
That's the next homework, to
worry about the comments.

46
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,110
And that's what you have to
get running for the second

47
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,360
homework this week.

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,130
