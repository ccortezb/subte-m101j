1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,190

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,470
OK.

3
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,670
Let's take you through the
solution to this problem.

4
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,530
Now again, we have to remove the
lowest homework score for

5
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,620
each student.

6
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,930
And that's going to be done by
finding each student and then

7
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,240
going through the list of the
assessments and finding the

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,260
lowest one.

9
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,660
It's a little bit tricky
compared to some of the other

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,300
code that we've written so
far for the homeworks.

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,150
So we start out by creating this
Remove Lowest function.

12
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,280
And you can see we're
connecting with the

13
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,640
MongoClient right here.

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,105
The MongoClient class to the
local MongoD server.

15
00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:34,880
Getting database school.

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,530
And then we're getting the
collection, students.

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,990
Now we're going to do a Find
across the entire collection

18
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,530
so we hit every document.

19
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,990
And now we're going
to iterate through

20
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,220
each of these students.

21
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,140
Now, we're going to get a DB
Object out of this collection

22
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,130
if we iterate across it.

23
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,620
And then we're going to call Get
Scores on each one to get

24
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,470
the scores array.

25
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,290
And we're going to cast that to
a basic DB List, because we

26
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,200
know that it is a list.

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,300
And you can see here I've
created a variable of DB List.

28
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,520
We need a sentinel value.

29
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,700
We need to know when we've
found the lowest one.

30
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,780
So we set this variable,
minScoreObj, null, initially.

31
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,880
And we set the minScore
that we've seen to

32
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,540
the Max Double Value.

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,670
In this collection, there's no
value above 100, so you could

34
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,480
probably set it to something
lower than that.

35
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,040
But this will certainly work.

36
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,800
And then down here, you can see
what we're doing is we're

37
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,430
iterating across the
scores collection.

38
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,110
Now, this is an array list.

39
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,470
And so we can iterate
directly across it.

40
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,545
What we're going to get out of
it is just simple objects.

41
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:38,300
Now, we know that they're much
more than that, but we'll have

42
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,070
to cast it after we reiterate
through it.

43
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,790
So we're iterating through it
using this for each command.

44
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,640
And then the object that we get
when we cast it to Basic

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,410
DB Object and put it in here.

46
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,370
Then we get the score
and the type.

47
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,620
Now, we're only interested
in homeworks.

48
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,370
So if the type was homework
and the score is less than

49
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:03,500
minScore, then we remembered
the value, the score.

50
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,060
Put it in the score variable.

51
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,150
And remember the object.

52
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,700
We do this.

53
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,560
When we're done, we're going
to have minScore pointed to

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,890
the lowest score and minScoreObj
pointing to the

55
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,690
object corresponding to that.

56
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,400
And this object, of course, came
from this scores list.

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,340
So now we're going
to go down here.

58
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,660
We're going to remove the
minScoreObj from the scores

59
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,430
array list.

60
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,650
It's a standard Remove
command.

61
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,570
And after that, we're going to
call the Update command,

62
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,510
MongoDB Update command.

63
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,400
We're going to find the student
record that has an

64
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,410
underscore ID equal to the ID
that we're working with.

65
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,940
And we're going to create a Set
command setting the scores

66
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,420
value to the scores key to the
scores array that we've been

67
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,660
working with and manipulating.

68
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,360
So this will remove
the lowest score.

69
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,470
So let's go through there
and watch it work.

70
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,450
I guess I'll show you the
values do change.

71
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,040
Let me do that first.

72
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,550
So if you run the aggregation
that we gave you before you

73
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,900
removed the lowest score for
each student, you see that

74
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,010
Student 85 has the
lowest average.

75
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,660
Now let's run this.

76
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,660
I ran it.

77
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,750
Now I'm going to go through
and look again.

78
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,660
Run the aggregation
command again to

79
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,840
find the lowest average.

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,200
And we're going to learn
about aggregation

81
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,270
in a follow-on unit.

82
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,750
And you can see the highest
average in the class is now

83
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,380
this student with ID 37.

84
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,340
So that has changed because
of our removal of data.

85
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,570
And we can see that the
data is removed.

86
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,820
So let's do that.

87
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,660

88
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,910
So you can see that now each of
the students has only three

89
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,980
assessments.

90
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,540
All right.

91
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,790
And that's the solution
to this problem.

92
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,020
