00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,950
In the third homework this
week, you're going to

3
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,190
implement comments.

4
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,620
So you're just going to extend
the system that you wrote to

5
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,990
permit a person to comment
on the blog post.

6
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,480
So if you click on a post,
you'll go to the permalink

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,580
page for the post.

8
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,550
And it says my second post.

9
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,870
And then the person should be
able to add a name, and

10
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,350
optionally an email,
and submit that.

11
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,710
And then you'll see that on the
bottom of this, there's

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,790
now a comment.

13
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,670
And I can add multiple
comments.

14
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,720
And of course, it should
support that.

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,189
It brought me back to
permalink page.

16
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,735
So you can just keep adding
comments over and over again.

17
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,220
And then you can submit it.

18
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,250
Don't worry about the
UI being rough.

19
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,870
The real point of this project
was to show you the mongo

20
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,130
parts of it, not to have
you worry about user

21
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,250
interface too much.

22
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,310
So that's the basic idea
of this homework.

23
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,700
And for this homework, just like
the last one, we've given

24
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,610
you a validation script.

25
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,140
And it's going to insert
comments into your blog.

26
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,460
And it's going to go check
and make sure that

27
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,530
they can read them.

28
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,450
And then it's also going to
check the collections to make

29
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,850
sure that they seem to be in
the collections properly.

30
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:03,230
All right.

31
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,480
That's it.

32
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,010
