1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,710
In this problem, you were asked
to change the code to

3
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,590
support adding a comment
to a post.

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,780
Again, you're going to be
working in the blog post DAO

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,250
class, and you only needed to
work on the code that adds the

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,480
comment because the comments are
already going to come out

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,360
of the posts automatically
in the retrieval code.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,240
And the template will
pick them out.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,155
And so you didn't need to make
any other changes to make sure

10
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,510
that you pulled them when you
pulled the document out, which

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,120
is a nice side effect of the
way this document oriented

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,240
database works.

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,410
So we gave you some hints,
again, that the email is

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,340
optional, but it could
come in as NULL.

15
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,550
Basically, we're going to create
a new comment, which is

16
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,100
the basic DB object.

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,010
It has an author, which is the
name that comes in here so

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:41,685
name is author.

19
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:43,100
You had to figure that out.

20
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,640
The body is the body.

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,830
Email, a little tricky.

22
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,870
You needed to make sure
it wasn't NULL and

23
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,060
that it wasn't blank.

24
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,390
And if it wasn't either
of those two things,

25
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,460
you'd append it.

26
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,150
The validation script doesn't
use the email parameter, so

27
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,135
this will come in as NULL.

28
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:56,860
And if you didn't protect
this, you

29
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,420
could get an exception.

30
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,130
And then, this is probably the
trickiest part right here.

31
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,340
You need to call the
update command.

32
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,740
The criteria is this permalink
that came in, so you're only

33
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,270
going to update the document
with that permalink.

34
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,970
But you had to use this push
command to push this comment

35
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,980
object that you've created on to
the array of comments, the

36
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,700
list of comments, inside
the document

37
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,630
with this push command.

38
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,480
And then, upsert false,
multifalse.

39
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,900
So that's how you do it, and
that will push this one

40
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,170
comment on to the list of
comments inside this

41
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,420
particular blog post.

42
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,640
