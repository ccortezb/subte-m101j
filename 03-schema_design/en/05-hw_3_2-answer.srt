1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,180

2
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,910
In this problem, we asked you
to make changes to your blog

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,150
so that it can accept
blog posts.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,740
All the work you needed to do is
in the blog post DAO class,

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,120
and I'm going to show you the
changes that you need to make.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,050
There were three of them.

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,070
The first is that you want to
be able to add posts, so you

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,260
had to work in this
add post function.

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,490
We gave you some hints.

10
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,690
The permalink was already
created for you and the other

11
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,720
items came in as parameters
in the function.

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,140
Now you create a new basic
DBObject, and then you put all

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,080
these keys and values
inside it.

14
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,250
You'll see here that the title
is put into the title, the

15
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,100
author is the author,
et cetera.

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,530
The permalink is the permalink
created above.

17
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,870
The tags, you could actually
add to this object without

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,690
making any changes because tags
already implements the

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,490
right interface, so that
basically the object can use

20
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,840
it directly.

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,820
And then in the comments part,
you need an empty set of

22
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,800
comments, and so what we've done
here is I've created a

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,430
new java util array list, which
is going to an empty

24
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,319
list, and then I added
it as the value

25
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,830
for this key comments.

26
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,850
And then for the date part,
I just used today's date.

27
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,280
And I do an insert right here.

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,660
I do it in a try, catch block
to make sure that there's no

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,310
error, and I return
the permalink.

30
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,670
Now you also need to retrieve
the post in

31
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,090
two different places.

32
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,340
The first is for
the blog index.

33
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,330
The number of posts you want
to retrieve comes in as a

34
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,580
limit, which is a parameter,
so we're just going to do a

35
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,080
find and we're going to
sort by this date.

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,030
And you can see the way that
works is you need to create a

37
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,660
basic DBObject and append the
name date, so that it knows

38
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,690
which key you are sorting by
with a value of minus 1 for

39
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,560
descending, and then you can
just call limit on it.

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,850
Limit is the number that
came in as a perimeter.

41
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,510
It's usually set to 10,
and the caller.

42
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,730
You can see I've created a list
of DBObjects right here,

43
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,590
and I do the find, and then I
can convert the entire results

44
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,480
of the find, the cursor, to an
array in one call using this

45
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,870
to array, call.

46
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,039
Then I put it in posts, and I
return it, and I close the

47
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,320
cursor on finally.

48
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,640
Now the next and last part is
that when you're on the blog

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,040
entry page, that is retrieved by
permalink, you're going to

50
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,400
need to pick up just the one
post out of the database that

51
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,450
corresponds to a particular
permalink.

52
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,670
You can see we've done that
here, created a new basic

53
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,420
DBObject to specify our
criteria with the key

54
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,070
permalink set to permalink,
which came

55
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,410
in inside this parameter.

56
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,220
And then I just set that equal
to post, and return post.

57
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,045
This works very naturally.

58
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:38,900
If it returned nothing, it would
return null, and so that

59
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,150
works just fine.

60
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,890
