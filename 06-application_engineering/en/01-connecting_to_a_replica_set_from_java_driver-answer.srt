1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,170

2
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,480
And the answer is two, the
missing node will be

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,960
discovered as long as you list
at least one valid node.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,710
And I should point out
one other thing.

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,650
It's always good to
list more than one

6
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,600
node in your seedlist.

7
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,400
Even though the driver will
discover all the nodes based

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,250
on a single node in the
seedlist, if that node happens

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,200
to be one that's been taken
down for maintenance, then

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,620
your application won't
start properly.

11
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,260
So it's always good to
list at least two

12
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,740
nodes in your seedlist.

13
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,990
