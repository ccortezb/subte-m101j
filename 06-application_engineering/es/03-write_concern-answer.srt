1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,820
And the answer is w equals
1, j equals 1.

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,260
j equals 1 is the only option
given here which actually

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,180
waits for acknowledgements
of the write to disk.

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,520
You could also use f sync
equals 1 as well.

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,870
But now that we have journaling,
f sync is not

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,500
really necessary.

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,560
Journaling provides us an
equivalent amount of

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,810
durability.

00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,110
