00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,170

2
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,050
The answer is no.

3
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,470
As we saw in this example,
you will get exceptions.

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,100
And it's up to you as an
application developer to

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,080
determine how you want to
respond to that exception,

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,440
whether you want to retry or
propagate the error to a

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,690
higher level.

8
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,240
