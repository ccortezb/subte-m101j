1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,190

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,680
All right, in this assignment
you're going to be

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,310
making the blog fast.

4
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,230
We've given you the code for
the blog in blog.py and

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,860
user.py in the views, and we've
also given you a data

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,940
set of 1,000 posts.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,700
Very patriotic posts if
you're an American.

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,020
We have the Gettysburg Address
here, and we also have the US

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,740
Constitution and the Declaration
of Independence,

10
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,660
and the Bill of Rights.

11
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,680
And all these posts have 50
comments on them and they have

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,800
a bunch of tags on them.

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,640
Now, there's three pages
you need to make fast.

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,700
You have to make the blog
homepage fast, which gets the

15
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,580
most recent 10 blog posts
and prints them out.

16
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,170
You also need to make
this page fast.

17
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,470
This is a page that will search
for the most recent 10

18
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,330
posts for any given tag.

19
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,510
I just clicked on tempo, so now
all these posts are going

20
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,850
to have tempo in them.

21
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,820
If I click on refund, then
all these posts will

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,690
have refund in them.

23
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,370
And the final page you have to
make fast is the blog post

24
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,840
page, which is referenced
by permalink.

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,940
I'll show you the permalink's
right here.

26
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,140
And then, it brings up the post,
just one post along with

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,490
the comments in the post and
there are 50 comments.

28
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,520
You need to make this
page fast as well.

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,190
Now, you don't ever need to run
the blog project for this

30
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,890
homework assignment, but you
might want to because you

31
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,290
might want to see the data.

32
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,520
But another reason why you want
to take a look at it is

33
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,070
that the queries that we're
going to check you on are the

34
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,740
ones that are inside the code
that produced these pages.

35
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,600
And you don't need to rewrite
them from scratch you can just

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,140
look in the blog.py file and
see what the queries are.

37
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,850
Now, the idea is that these
queries should only scan as

38
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,630
many documents as they return.

39
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,630
So if it returns 10 documents
it should scan 10 documents.

40
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,760
If it's returning
one document, it

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,310
should return one document.

42
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,580
And our validate program.

43
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,290
What it does is it runs these
queries, it gets the explain

44
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,840
output, and it makes sure that
you've added the right

45
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,840
indexes, so that this is fast.

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,650
And that's the assignment
for this week.

47
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,900
