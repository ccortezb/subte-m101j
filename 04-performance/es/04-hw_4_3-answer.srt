1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,250

2
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:00,980
OK.

3
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,990
And the answer is that in order
to make the queries

4
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,039
fast, the home page, the look
up by tag, and the permalink

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,310
page, you need three
different indexes.

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,550
So, to make the homepage fast,
you need an index on just the

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,070
date field because that's
what the homepage does.

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,630
And I did it date descending,
although you could do it date

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,780
ascending and it will reverse
it for that purpose.

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,590
To make the permalink page look
up fast, you just need a

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,110
index on permalink.

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,060
And to make it fast to look
up all the posts from a

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,770
particular tag and then order
them by date, you need a

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,580
compound index on
tags comma date.

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,940
And I made it descending on
date, reflecting that we're

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,320
going to show them
in reverse order.

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,360
Although, if you had made it
ascending on date, Mongo can

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,530
still manage to use that index
in the case where you're

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,020
sorting only by date and you're

20
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,720
looking up only one tag.

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,920
So that's the answer to
this problem, and I

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,170
hope you got it right.

23
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,100
