00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,400
Welcome to week four.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,640
Congratulations on making
it to this point.

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,820
This week we're going to
talk about performance.

5
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,800
Now computer system performance
is driven by lots

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,170
of factors, including the
speed of the underlying

7
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,870
operations, like the disk
and memory and the CPU.

8
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,000
But the largest driver for
performance is going to be

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,870
your algorithmic performance.

10
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,300
And for a database server,
that's going to be how fast

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,250
can we execute queries.

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,720
And that's driven by whether or
not the database can use an

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,700
index to look data up.

14
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,990
So this week we're going to
talk a lot about indexes.

15
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,350
We're going to talk about what
they are, we're going to talk

16
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,280
about how to create them, and
we're going to talk about how

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,640
you figure out which parts
of your program are slow.

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,250
Finally, we're going to discuss
sharding a little bit,

19
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,340
which is a technique for
breaking up large collections

20
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,700
across multiple servers to
exploit greater parallelism.

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,850
Now performance is normally
the domain of database

22
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,600
administrators, but good
developers have an

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,370
understanding of performance.

24
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,770
They write with performance in
mind, and they can find their

25
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,350
own performance problems
within their programs.

26
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,600
So let's get started.

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,690
