1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,870
All right, and the answer is
that the query scanned 10

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,390
million documents, returning
in 5.2 seconds.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,230
So, you can see here that this
is 5,000 milliseconds, which

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,210
is actually 5.2 seconds if you
round it, and we did look at

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,850
the full 10 million
documents here.

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,400
You can see 10 million documents
right there.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,820
And several of these are wrong
in different ways.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,440
Now this is the query, by the
way, on our large student

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,350
collection of grades when
we don't hit an index.

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,990
So it was a query that returned
100,000 documents and

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,490
had a look at every single
document to do it, and

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,330
therefore, took over five
seconds without an index.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,580
That's what this query was.

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,410
